## General Workflow
- Use a TDD approach, write a failing unit test, implement the feature, then re-run the unit test. Repeat until feature is complete and all unit tests pass. 
- aim for 80% code coverage 
- before creating a commit, make sure all tests pass
- create deployment steps in the scripts section of package.json, but do not deploy automatically, the user will do this manually
